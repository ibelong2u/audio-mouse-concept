# Audio Mouse Concept
## Audible Assistance Indicating Mouse Pointer Coordinates

_This project was built for Windows XP on Visual Studio 2005. It relies on outdated libraries and might be missing some files. This code will no longer compile into a functioning application. This repository was created as a personal archive for older projects._

### Concept

1. This application runs in the background and can be triggered by shortcut key combination.

2. On pressing the shortcut, the application plays a pair of audible beeps corresponding to the (X,Y) coordinate of the mouse pointer location.

3. The frequency of the beep is calibrated based on the display resolution, and based on preset lowest and highest frequency.

4. This preset may be customized based on preferences. A higher range would allow for a larger gradient in frequency levels.

5. This is meant to assist the visually impaired with approximating the location of mouse pointer on the display.
